This is one heap of bad decisions.

None of this is really expected to make sense to anyone, not even me
in a week.  As far as I can tell, m4 was designed as a way for hackers
to do puzzle games while still appearing to be getting actual work
done.

Lessons learned:

* Modularity and code reuse in m4 is fantastically difficult.

* Emacs' m4-mode doesn't properly handle coloring the $# variable; it
  thinks it's a begin-comment delimiter.

* My system's m4 doesn't have the changesyntax builtin.  In
  retrospect, this is probably good.
