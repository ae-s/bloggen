This is one heap of bad decisions.  I can already feel the technical
debt piling up, if you can believe it.

But hey, I'm implementing a blog-post DSL in m4.  What do you expect,
beauty?

None of this is really expected to make sense to anyone, not even me
in a week.  As far as I can tell, m4 was designed as a way for hackers
to do puzzle games while still appearing to be getting actual work
done.

Lessons learned:

* Modularity and code reuse in m4 is fantastically difficult.

* Emacs' m4-mode doesn't properly handle coloring the $# variable; it
  thinks it's a begin-comment delimiter.

* My system's m4 doesn't have the changesyntax builtin.  In
  retrospect, this is probably a good thing.

To use this program, create some posts similar to this: (order of post
components does not matter)


  post(
  title(Secodary post dude)
  text(«<p>dude.</p>
  
  <p>DUDE.</p>»)
  tags(foo, bar, baz)
  date(12-Feb-2012)
  author(Duncan)
  )


Name the files «whatever.html.m».

Then type

  make whatever.html tag-foo.html tag-bar.html tag-baz.html

Sooner or later, this will be automated away.
